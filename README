To build, do `make build`.
To run, use grun, i.e.: `grun calculator exprList test/test1.bc`

For automated test: `cd test/; ./auto-test.sh`
Note: some tests are marked incorrect due to integer vs float output (e.g. 1 vs 1.0)

The calculator implements all the features required. Input can be either ints or floats, however all outputs (including booleans) are printed as floating-point numbers.

Features:
- Comments
- Variables and expressions with variables
- Boolean expressions
- Precedence and order-of-operations
- read to get input from stdin
- statements are printed just as bc prints
- print function takes in list of expressions and prints them in order
- math library functions (s, c, l, e)
